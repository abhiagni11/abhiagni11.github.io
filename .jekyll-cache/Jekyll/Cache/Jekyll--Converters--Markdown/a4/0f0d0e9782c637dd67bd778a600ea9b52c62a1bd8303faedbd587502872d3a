I"<p>Hi! I am Abhijeet Agnihotri. You can call me ‘a bee.’ I’m a human-robot-interaction (HRI) researcher, designer, a serious hobbyist musician, and an avid runner. On a single day, you can find me doing all of these things.</p>

<p>I like to create and explore. I help discover ways that robots can solve problems for people as well as finding ways for robots and humans to have natural, intelligent, and enjoyable interactions. This requires the involvement of multiple engineers, researchers, and designers, my strength is in liaising with different people, which my background has prepared me for!</p>

<p>I am currently working as a UX developer within the robotics user experience and industrial design team at the <a href="https://www.tri.global/about-us/abhijeet-agnihotri">Toyota Research Institute</a>, in Cambridge, MA, USA. To learn more about my background, take a look at my <a href="https://abhiagni.com/cv">CV</a>. I am an active part of the HRI community and my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y9cqHWsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">research</a> has been published as extended abstracts and full papers at past HRI conferences, including being selected as an HRI Pioneer at HRI 2019, in S. Korea. I am also part of the open source <a href="https://f1tenth.org/">f1tenth</a> community, aimed at getting autonomous systems knowledge out to the general public.</p>

<p>I was always interested in technology and robotics. However, the turning point for me was my internship at Stanford after my junior year. That year, I built a robotic chair that roamed around in a hall and could approach people in “interesting” ways. For example, gently bumping into a person to persuade them to follow it or signaling different intentions through its motion. The goal behind the chairbot project was to explore different interactions between a human and a robotic object. This explorative experience was transformative for me because it showed me how creative the field of robotics really is.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, I realized that robotics is actually about the human interacting with the robot rather than the other way around.</p>
